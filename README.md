## xUnit tests
- test if there is an numerator, denominator and operator.
- test if the denominator is not zero.
- test for all the different operators with positive and negative numbers.
- test the result and ToString methodes.

## Future Improvements:
- Being able to add more fractions.
- Theme options for the user.
- Adding rounded corners.
- Better responsive design.
